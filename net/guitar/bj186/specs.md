# BigJohn bj186

## Specs
- Stranberg Boden shaped clone
- headless head + bridge, 
- mahogany body + veneer
- maple neck
- rosewood fingerboard
- 24 frets
- 3 way switch
- HH passive pickups (non-splittable?) + 500/500k pots

## On arrival
- it's a cheapshit chinese guitar,
but build is above par for that
- pickups are horrible
- nice wood, resists shock well, hardly chipped or dented
- switch is stiff
- bridge operates well, lock nut on top
- no finish
- fretwork a bit shoddy, neck especially is a weird fanned design
- assembled kit, too bad since it's unfinished and must be taken apart
