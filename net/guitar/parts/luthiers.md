# working with luthiers

- professional luthiers here are pussies
- they'll only accept parts from official catalogues and if ordering themselves, at twice the price
- will never accept atypical work or cheaper parts or attempt atypical modifications
- change of strings + adjustments: 60eu
- fee for any mods: 60 eu


## refretting

- this would cost potentially upwards of 400eu
- one quote online was circa 12eu per fret
- even if we learn to do it ourselves, kh602 would be tricky (finish, construction)
