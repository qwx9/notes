# choice between locking tuners and locking nut

- de-tuning depends on string mass,
string-nut/string-nut/etc friction,
etc.

- neither will prevent de-tuning, only slow it

- according to [1], tuners provide better stability

- both rely on simple technology

[1](https://guitarunit.com/locking-nut-vs-locking-tuners-whats-the-best-for-you):
comparison between the two, seems biased in favor of locking nut
