# locking nut

see [comparison](locking.nut.vs.tuners)

- replacement for stock nut,
used to prevent strings from de-tuning,
by immobilizing them

- potentially less expensive than [locking tuners](locking.tuners)

- may require filing down the top of the neck to fit (fender strat)

- hard to find a good one wrt string action

- requires good fine tuners on the bridge

- in other words, perfectly fine if pre-installed

- requires bridge capable of fine tuning,
locking the nut detunes the strings somewhat
