## 20201014

- neck maintenance, used dunlop shit
- changed strings to 8-38 extra slinky
- readjustments everywhere
- truss rod access is fucked, need screwdriver with wrapped end hammered in slightly
- installed dunlop straplok and got new strap
- replaced dead 22nF capactitor with 47nF one, don't have any others
- had to lower neck pickup a lot to avoid hitting the bass-end strings,
a ridiculous amount
- had to lower middle pickup a bunch to avoid hitting it with the pick
- fairly low string action, now playable
- low E string buzz
- too noisy
- high-pitched wail at volumes 6-8, dead potentiometer?
- neck/middle pickups sound like shit, bridge has too much treble


## TODO

- adjust pickup height

- experiment with different capacitors

- replace potentiometers with push-pull ones, ordered type B

- modify wiring, attempt to get better sound out of neck/middle pickups, reduce noise

- maybe change pickups one day

- self lubricating nut?

- install locking tuners, or locking nut + change bridge
