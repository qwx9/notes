# alternative picking exercises

- remember short speed bursts in cycling => same thing here, double rhythm
- practice legato the same with the same exercises
- practice tapping by adding notes to them

## scales

- major A (major F for us) scale 7 mode positions
	* 5th, 4th, 2nd, 7th, 9th, 11th, 12th position (0th)
	* traverse 4 notes at a time,
	move up by 1 note each time,
	from lowest to highest then back
- intervals
	* traverse scale on each position
	* 2 note, 3 note, 4 note, etc.
	* recognize actual intervals
- same thing, moving between positions
