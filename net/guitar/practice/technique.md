# notes on technique and usage

## picks and picking
- seems thick picks work best for me, 3mm picks with a groove and scarring for grip are best so far
- light touch and minimum exposed pick surface
- correct pick and hand (rotational) angle when picking,
make sure playing upper strings works the same,
don't dig into lower strings from below
