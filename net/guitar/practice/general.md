# important general notes

## practice routines
- daily habit, same time, over long time
- daily topics/blocks
- vary bpm: very slow (technique), mid (tightness), very fast (push)
	. do not always work at high tempos, esp in beginning when sucking
- move technique exercises on different positions, scales, shapes, etc
- learn something
- track progress: exercises, tempos (bpm numbers), consistencies
- solo/improv
	. choose position, shape, notes and work your way up adding more and more
	. even just 7 notes inside a single octave
	. can choose an easy one like Emaj pentatonic
	. basic blocks
		* repeat notes
		* change note duration
		* change direction
		* skip strings (intervals)
		* repeatable patterns
		* articulation: vibrato, legato, picking, slides, ghosts, dynamics, etc
		* each of these can be added one by one
		* phrasing: break down positions by root tone into sections
			- start on root, end on root: builds ear, licks
		* from then on, sky's the limit
	. learn to improv on metal styles: trash, death, black, progressive
	. basic improv routines on E pentatonic and Amaj major scale (positions)
		* a lot can be done already by exploring two-note chords/intervals

## combining theory and technique
- between vinnie moore's lessons, and the rest, there's a clear pattern
- triplets and other typical exercises can be moved up and down scales vertically and horizontally
- both practice scale/mode forms and technique at the same time


## things to vary using the same ideas
- triplets, quadruplets, etc. and note order
- moving horizontally/vertically
- different modes, different scales
- note duration, rhythms
- dynamics: light picking
- muting, ghost notes, eliminating noise
- palm muting + legato + etc
- down/up picking, alternative picking
- sweep picking
- tapping, legato
- natural/tap/pinch harmonics
- chords and transitions
- using pedals and the fucking switch!
