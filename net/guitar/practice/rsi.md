# rsi and prevention

## warm-ups and cool down

- essential, but must consist of active warm-ups, not stretches
	* rotations: wrists, elbows, shoulders
- stretches must be done after the session
	* stretch wrists, fingers, elbows, shoulders


## hygene

- good hydration is essential
- malnutrition probably sucks too
	* intensive practice while very hypocaloric probably stupid
- massages help circulation


## position

- obviously, good body and hand positions are important
- body should be relaxed and posture correct
- likewise, arms and wrists must be relaxed as well
- fretting hand strain is amplified if wrist is stretched more
- shortening guitar strap up helps both hands
	* because base sitting position has guitar high
- might have to attempt to rotate neck towards the ground somewhat
	* attempt to alleviate wrist strain a bit
	* fretboard should be a bit visible still
	* playing standing up might help find a good position


## inflammation

- ice packs/cold water help reduce it
	* but useless besides inflammation, be aware of it
- wrist straps are useless
- the best way is to rest the muscles and arm
