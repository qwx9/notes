# weight notes

## bmi

- bmi = weight / height² [kg/m²]
- underweight < 18.5
- normal [18.5,25.0[
- overweight [25.0,30.0[
- obese ≥ 30.0
- for a given height, "healthy" interval is [bmiL * height²,bmiH * height²[
- us: 58.6 - 79.2


## anorexia

- sport alone is insufficient
- regardless of amount, keep protein intake high
- daily caloric intake ≤ 750kcal works
- can only really last a few days
	* hunger explodes afterwards
	* same as warnings on extreme diet a few years back
	* the first few days are easy, until body reaches a critical point
	* forcing it to then adapt to a very different regimen takes a week
	* full readaptation takes a few weeks
	* but then, unless extreme care is taken, regular diet becomes dangerous
- below 1000kcal, symptoms appear fast
	* low blood pressure, bradycardia and asthenia most of all
	* typical: 110/65 44
	* forcing sport is reveiling: raises blood pressure and heart rate,
	but still within normal rest levels
- this is very much bordering danger
- must not be sustained long
- while there's a big margin for losing weight,
going down to 65kg is getting very near the lower limit
- in other words, 65kg is the lower bound for any of this shit
