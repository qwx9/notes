## Log
- adjusted front dérailleur
- adjusted rear brakes
- added bell
- adjusted handlebar height and rotation
- adjusted saddle in all 3 axes
- changed brake cables, readjusted brake pads
- changed tires and corresponding tubes → 26·1.95
- removed handlebar grips and replaced with double layer tape
- added random front and rear mudflap and a broken gourd thing
- higher saddle position again
- fix handlebar axial plane angle,
the bar was rotated almost opposite to what it should be
- readjusted shifter and bell rotation
- total cost: 50 + brake cables, tubes < 100

## TODO
- wheel must be trued, wobbles way too much
- reinstall brakes
- better lubrication for brake cables
- properly resoldering the broken gourd thing would be nice,
but don't have the tools
- missing front light
- front dérailleur still a bit off
- missing rear light
