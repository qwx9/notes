## common

- light gardening


## stack top and more random shit

- drum:
	* anatomy of drumming and related books
	* pinky/ring finger grip technique
	* minimizing strain, see common injuries
	* get fucking goddamn sheet music from somewhere
- find out about quick memorization techniques,
and long term massive information stores
	* vidid fun stories with strong connections for quick sequences
		- this is practically sufficient, when well used,
		for memory world competetions
		- but have to learn to do it
	* spaced repetition for massive knowledge
	* others? more fun? easier? more adapted?
	* mindmap/wiki -> ?
- latest files from emails et al
- more applications
- sba: this week and another 2 left, imperative all is done this week
- dcd: lectures
- dcd: project, already started? need for next week
- vdb
- gge: first lectures
- dcd: classes/dcd/kdd.introduction.itemsets (cours1-3)
- user install of texlive on obsd
- cv in latex
- reinstall kertex, see tlaronde mails, take notes
- cover letters in kertex
- cv in kertex
- report in kertex
- notes on latex
- u28 obsd disk: make it a work env
	* R, python, etc.
	* all the shit we'd need from the linux: .??* etc
	* scripts
	* inkscape, gimp and the other one
	* see all installed programs + ~/s (=> some sys dir)
	* ~/s programs
	* latex
	* discord et al
	* default shit to communicate with plan9 and use from there
		- drawterm
		- vnc
		- 9pfs
		- etc
	* etc
	* merge bookmarks from obsd and linux
- mkey seems off by one octave, jesus
	* mst as well
	* piano, piano32 are fine
	* i don't understand wtf Amavect's pianoJI is about
		looking at a chromatic tuner,
		umbraticus' piano is hitting exact frequencies
		whereas pianoJI is noticeably off
		different application? amend post
- p/sce bin
	* games/sce or sce/sce
	* sce/... tools
	* remove from /amd64 /386 /arm
	* add in profile
- sce: rgba for shadows
- pitch: basic implementation
- merge more notes...
- notes: note/mv
- notes: integrate lectures and formatting
- notes: generate html for page or tree or pdf/whatever for page
- notes: modify discount markdown if necessary
- rc: ok, fuck rc quoting: add backwards compatible quoting system
using an ascii delimiter like sigrid suggested
	* this will help with passing shit to rio -k, window, eval, etc
	* note: probably won't be merged since use will break compat with others
	but patch is available
- chrab
- p/rc: readme with description of scripts
- p/rc/fn -> rc scripts
- bindbins: option for prefix for remote
- replace lr with walk in scripts and fn, remove lr from misc
- consider doing classes for skillshare/whatever or something like it
- music, playlists
- d3graph: develop the graph package idea first with d3 only, then ts then vue3 also
- sba+dcd+vdb lectures for next week
	* feed mbioinf and notes with them
- clean appt
- continue w520 and t60p setup
- replace bv9100 battery
- script to regen cmus playlists on u26b
- fender mods: come up with a test bed so we can test things directly
	* either on the guitar itself
	* or a mock setup with a strings/pickups outside of body
	* maybe get discarded pickups to fuck around with
	* or just make one
- more notes on diy pickups etc, from bookmarks
- split pitch todo into proj/stack entries
	* display
	* notes on fft
	* analysis
	* etc
- asif: dcd shit
	* mine directory
- asif: add pathfinding here
	* path directory
	* will contain testing algos/impl shit too?
	* path(1) would use drop-in files from asif
- asif: add simple pitch tracking?
	* dsp directory
	* fft file
	* filtering
	* windowing
	* etc
	* single file simple fft audio pitch tracker that pitch would use
- pitch: check that mic recording replicates left chan to right
- pitch: can use norm to amplify when above threshold
- pplay: shorter input -> why aren't we zeroing out the rest of the fft buffer?
- pplay: fix fft from pitch, nuke fplay
- pplay: spectrogram scaled to musical notes c0 - b8
- fork pplay for guitarshit and editing, come up with a name
- pplay: once we have another program for editing, remove shit like writing short buffers
- pplay: better controls, esp looping/panning
- pplay: better performance, esp redraw (riow -> force redraw)
- pplay fork: modify controls
- mbioinf: populate, nuke vdb repo
- såmtörm: samterm fork with ham tweaks and other ± såm if we change shit
	* -a by default
	* color tweaks (no direct display->white/black, etc)
	* or break it down entirely and integrate with rio directly
	* scroll past screen
	* large file support
	* list other grievances...
- icrop: interactive image cropping via window size
- more advanced tool for interactive image editing/analysis
	* paint already does pixel editing and has undo/redo,
	but overloading it with more shit might be teh suck
		. can add commands like crop canvas to window
		. could add < > ^ for external commands, start
		an rc and barf the canvas to stdout
		. but, undo/redo changes?
		. maybe paint should just... paint
	* instead, could integrate paint: call it on the canvas,
	read result in, etc.
	* could integrate pico as well, both with issuing expressions as usual,
	and using predefined expressions/templates for common shit
		. another occasion to fix its fucking syntax
	* multi-image editing like in sam
	* way to generate gifs (or unix scripts like kvik's x to ffmpeg)
	* way to edit gifs, adding text etc
		. even get the common meme fonts working
	* so, interactiveness useful for interactive and visual tweaking
	like cropping, etc.
		. hell could output command for snarfing in a script
	* way to also edit/load palettes and paletted images, without
	weird program-specific formats
	* check what sigrid/hundredrabbits/gridders have done wrt image editing
	* come up with a clever name
	* like page(1): call external programs for certain operations,
	let user pipe to programs on his own,
	let user define functions doing this
		⇒ pico, resize, etc
- some program to write a plan9 image as a c byte or u32int array


## notes

- situation as of next week:
	* no sba/vdb/dcd until week after

	* 10 3h gge sessions left, 7 done
	⇒ have to go through sba+dcd+vdb as quickly as possible,
	and move on to gge
- numerical recipes has sections on linear and dynamic programming,
among others
