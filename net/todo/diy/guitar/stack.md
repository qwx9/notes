## List of guitar jobs

## General notes
See [random design notes](design).


## Fender mim deluxe player's strat
See [fender's todo](fender).


## ⑨ST
See [⑨ST](⑨ST).


## ⑨HD
Finishes and minor modifications (pickups etc) to new headless clone.


## ⑨HDEN
⑨HD with new Stranberg EndurNeck-like handmade
fan-fret 6 string neck,
with necessary pickup/bridge modifications.

### Materials
- 750x100x25 blank, mahogany to fit the rest, or something else
- 750x100 fretboard (or less, enough for 25.5"),
unless we can get away with the 2 piece design somehow
- truss rod, 2x carbon reinforcement rods
- tighteners for gluing the pieces together, a bunch
- phosphorescent inlays
- might get our own nut and head piece if there's better ones for cheap


## ⑨HD8
As ⑨HDEN, but now with fan-fret 8 string neck,
with the guitar modified to fit the neck and design.

Random 8str neck on ali:
- 25.5" scale (wrong)
- 71cm total length
- 50cm fretboard length
- heel 7.5cm wide, 2.5cm deep
- upper nut 5.3

24 frets → let's say there's 16cm to the bridge from the neck socket.
That 8str neck from ali is 50 long on the fretboard

	25.5" = 64.77cm
	50 + 16 = 66, bridge would be closer


### Materials
- 750x100x25 blank, mahogany to fit the rest, or something else
- 750x100 fretboard (or less, enough for 25.5"),
unless we can get away with the 2 piece design somehow
- more stainless steel jumbo xl frets
- truss rod, 2x carbon reinforcement rods
- tighteners for gluing the pieces together, a bunch
- phosphorescent inlays
- headpiece for 8 strings, nut
- bridge
- pickups


## ⑨TR6
Board guitar made from the spare parts from the previous projects.


## ⑨M8M
DIY Meshuggah guitar.
Handmade body and neck imitating the M8M design,
but headless/EN design, multiple pickups.
Fixed bridge if possible.
Possibly scalloped frets, who knows.

Body blank has to be circa 50x32x5cm (19.7x12.6x1.96in).

27" = 68.58cm.
29.4" scale = 74.676cm.
Technically, without a headstock,
we might still be able to use the same plank dimensions,
which are easily available on ebay,
unless we find a good supplier.

m80m specs: 29.4" for D♯/A♯/F♯ - F♯ tuning (std F♯?).
Combustion actually has 8th string at F1, not D♯1.

- neck 749mm/29.4"
- nut width 55
- bridge width 80
- thickness at 1st fret 19.5
- thickness at 12th 21.5
- 400mmR radius


## Pedals/electronics

Parts already available, just need to get started.
Read on the basic ideas and what can affect tone, etc.

What would be nice:
tune-down,
preamp wrt passive components,
sustainer.

Integrated would be cool.

### Distorision pedals
There are schematics for clones of popular distorsion pedals,
but: complicated builds.

- need making a circuitboard
- condensing all of this shit into pedal-sized board
means tricky soldering

And, they are still only clones, sometimes with more controls.
We already have several of these pedals, factory-made.
In other words, what could we actually do better?
