# ⑨ST: (9) stratocaster

## todo: body
- sand paint to thin layer
- enlarge tremolo cavity for corrected measurements (deepen),
clean up edges (watch the paint! and mark tremolo position on cavity walls)
- apply wax
- drill tremolo support holes
- drill tremolo spring plate holes and place the plate
- drill strap peg holes (test the strapshits first), place pegs
- drill pick guard holes
- drill holes for jack plate
- enlarge cavity if needed
- 2pass-sand/wax/finish guitar cavity (maybe no waxing, for mods)
- cover cavity with copper tape
- drill/enlarge whatever holes are needed for the wiring
- cover cavities with copper tape
- mirror polish
- place wired pickguard and output jack plate
- place tremolo bridge/springs
- place strings and springs and setup action, intonation for tuning: dstd


## todo: neck
- shorten neck back to bring it forward towards the bridge 2-3mm (actually a lot more)
- fit neck to the body, be able to fasten it for measurements and working on the bridge
- etch some logo or something on the head? (carving also an option)
- perhaps thin neck a bit? check if this would help (just with like sanding)
- sand, wax
- drill for tuners and install them
- scallop frets? probably don't need to go super deep
- level, polish frets
- possibly replace frets with jumbo xl, these are pretty low
- fingerboard finish
- polish neck and head


## todo: electronics
- decide on wiring for HSH passive pickups setup
	* phase switch, split coils switch
	* would be nice to get some additional useful combinations,
	or maybe just have all of them and test all?
		. we probably don't really need to switch between all of these quickly
- preamp? sustainer? octave? octave would be great
- move switch position further forward for easier access
- perhaps move tone controls back, we mostly want volume; check what makes sense
- cut, sand, drill pick guard to fit humbuckers and altered body and neck
- plan for new pick guard template for blank, to be done later
- cover pick guard inner side with copper tape
- wire pick guard


## log
- traced for tuner holes, will have to do everything else before drilling shit
- drilled and installed locking nut and retainer bar
- cut down nut bolts to be flush against its base
- head: cut and sand fretboard for locking nut placement
- REpainted all over again; just the grain looks like shit,
we'll paint again instead and sand to a thin layer so the grain shows
- painted all over and began sanding it away again
- 180→240→water→240 sanding again
- sanded all the paste away
- spraying with water before final sanding particularly effective
- lots of scratches and shit will remain...
- enlarged tremolo cavity; it's no longer a snug fit on the sides;
place using post notches and neck position
- checked neck position; moving tremolo back 2-3mm to use previous tremolo post notches
- sanding manually all the wood paste; other methods aren't soft enough, and this doesn't really waste too much sandpaper as long as it's cleaned up, only one sheet thrown so far
- sanded wood paste all the way to leave only grain; result doesn't look great; will apply just red paint and sand again, test looks good
- noticed tremolo position is wrong yet again, we have 22fret; measured 7mm difference, will subtract from both bridge and neck since bridge support will be too thin
- applied wood paste mixed with some red paint on all surface
- retraced tremolo position and chiseled further forward
- filled tremolo holes with wood paste by multiple layers
- noticed tremolo is too far back, used the wrong trace for saddle position, and peg holes too wide
- drilled tremolo peg holes, required thinning sides of the body because only a shitty column drill and little patience
- chiseled deeper middle/back for tremolo clearance and string fasteners clearance
- traced tremolo bridge position and chiseled exact shape into wood (circa 5mm), to be widened later
- measured tremolo bridge position for centered and 25.5" nut-saddle scale, assuming 21fret neck
- reinforced front and back of bridge holding section with 3mm steel plates
- deepened the c-shape notch for the fretting hand for easier access to high frets
