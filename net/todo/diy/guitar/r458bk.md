# TODO for r458bk

## TODO
- see where we could place a new switch and how to do it
- shield cavity: it can have an effect even if not everything can be covered
	. alternative is shielded wires which we don't have

## Mods
- remove body and neck varnish/paint and do it again
(glossy black finish or something else)
- move/modify location of switch, maybe knobs as well
- different wiring, like kh602: 2 individual volume controls + tone knob


## Log
- tuning proves difficult; increased neck bow, will continue later
- restringing
- tuner assembly, restringing
- nut correctly glued
- glued nut, first attempt failed (~4h clamped), now new attempt with 24h clamp
- cleaned/oiled/waxed fretboard
- leveled/recrowned frets a bit, but they're still not level;
low frets are thinned too much already
- polish/wax
- new graphtech nut from blank
- more fronting, better
- really varnish back, better, this time taped everything tightly
- only one tusq is of necessary size for this nut, 1/4" one
- neck varnish front and back
