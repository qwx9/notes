# TODO for r458bk

## TODO
- sand varnish
- buff/polish/wax
- properly slotted tusq nut from blank
- locking tuners
- level frets
- lemon oil and wax fretboard
- see where we could place a new switch and how to do it
- shield cavity: it can have an effect even if not everything can be covered
	. alternative is shielded wires which we don't have

## Mods
- sand body and black glossy paint OR: fill holes (same paint? +wood filler?) -> real varnish -> polish
- move/modify location of switch, maybe knobs as well


## Log
- more fronting, better
- really varnish back, better, this time taped everything tightly
- only one tusq is of necessary size for this nut, 1/4" one
- neck varnish front and back
