# TODO for r458bk

## Electronics
- copper tape interior â†’ cavity is small, probably useless?
	. could do it anyway, just have to be careful
	. not sure it would benefit much given that we can't shield all the cavities

## Next time strings are removed
- remove neck
- locking tuners
- properly slotted tusq nut from blank
- level frets
- sand and varnish neck, maybe transfer some propaganda on it?
	. if the polyurethane transfer works, sure
	. what?
		* catclock
		* fuck computers, computers as fuck
		* peace through superior firepower, across neck
		* hatehatehate/nopenopenope
		* usa#1 military insignia or signs
		* pjw, pico art
		* shitty black metal covers
		* doom/quake/wolf3d etc
		* pico art of some propaganda
- lemon oil and wax fretboard
- see where we could place a new switch and how to do it

## Mods
- body varnish?
- move/modify location of switch, maybe knobs as well
