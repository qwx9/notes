# TODO for r458bk

## Quick fixes
- higher pickup height on bass side

## Electronics
- copper tape interior â†’ cavity is small, probably useless?

## Next time strings are removed
- level frets
- properly slotted tusq nut from blank
- sand neck
- neck varnish, maybe after transfer of some propaganda or something?
- fretboard finish/oil etc
- locking tuners
- readjustments for new strings

## Mods
- body varnish?
- move/modify location of switch, maybe knobs as well
