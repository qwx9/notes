# TODO for r458bk

## TODO
- debug electronics
- new new nut, see notes below

## Mods
- remove body and neck varnish/paint and do it again
(glossy black finish or something else)
- move/modify location of switch AND knobs
- different wiring, like kh602: 2 individual volume controls + tone knob
	. might be possible even with these pickups, research it


## Log
- removed new nut and placed old one again,
then readjusted everything;
there's buzz on the lower strings still, but fuck it;
need proper files (or alternatives) and proper procedure for making a new nut,
need to place it and measure, etc;
previously used stock bone nut as reference
and used drill and saw for slotting,
which is slightly insane even if it kinda works
- pots/switch still slightly fucked up and lots of ground noise
	. not sure bridge is grounded despite the wire
- debugging
	. missing ground connection between two pots
	. switch connections were fucked due to flux overflow covering the pads;
	used contact spray to remove it
	. same for pots!
	. still fucked up, ground noise and loose connections
- installed new pickups
	. opted for first option: volume + push/pull tone pot + 5 way 4 pole megaswitch
	. pot holes did not go deep enough, so extra nut under the surface was removed
	. jack diameter is larger than old one, so older (black) nuts did not fit
	. the soldering job is messy
	. battery placement: wrap in electric tape,
	then glue with two-sided tape on left side, which is essentially empty
	. doesn't work, no output
- removed circuitry
- revarnishing of body, now ready
- the neck and headstock need good sanding, we're afraid of it, but we shouldn't be,
the surface must be perfectly smooth
- locking tuners hold in tune slightly better, so that's success all things considered!
- the problem is the new nut, the string saddles are too low
	. the nut is fashioned after the factory nut which itself is flawed
	. the strings seated too low, there's an angle with the bridge, which is higher
	. so the action is too low and the strings buzz
	. to fix action and intonation, all we can do is raise the bridge ridiculously high
	. so the angle is higher but the strings are raised up on the lower frets
	. obviously, intonation is fucked either way
	. so: we need a NEW new nut, with corrected string height,
	making sure we have a good reference for it
	. the nut's grooves were angled on the high strings too,
	so avoid that
- tuning proves difficult; increased neck bow, will continue later
- tuner assembly, restringing
- nut correctly glued
- glued nut, first attempt failed (~4h clamped), now new attempt with 24h clamp
- cleaned/oiled/waxed fretboard
- leveled/recrowned frets a bit, but they're still not level;
low frets are thinned too much already
- polish/wax
- new graphtech nut from blank
- more fronting, better
- really varnish back, better, this time taped everything tightly
- only one tusq is of necessary size for this nut, 1/4" one
- neck varnish front and back
