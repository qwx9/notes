# TODO for r458bk

## TODO
- new new nut, see notes below
- sand neck and headstock again
- remove pickups
- shield cavity, fuck it
- see where we could place a new switch and how to do it
- replace pickups
	. new switch
	. active pickups and battery placement
	. different wiring than recommended? see below
		* several stock options
		* stock 1: volume + tone pot
		* stock 2: single push-pull
		* stock 3: volume + push-pull tone
		* we'd like push-pull for voice + individual volume + tone?
		* so, one push-pull for each pickup + one regular tone pot
			- have to change cap value? pot value?
			- jb's pickups are wired that way, check it out
			- no switch is provided, but we have a 5-way superswitch
			- we can add additional switches if needed
			- just verify and check placement and space

## Mods
- remove body and neck varnish/paint and do it again
(glossy black finish or something else)
- move/modify location of switch, maybe knobs as well
- different wiring, like kh602: 2 individual volume controls + tone knob


## Log
- revarnishing of body, now ready
- the neck and headstock need good sanding, we're afraid of it, but we shouldn't be,
the surface must be perfectly smooth
- locking tuners hold in tune slightly better, so that's success all things considered!
- the problem is the new nut, the string saddles are too low
	. the nut is fashioned after the factory nut which itself is flawed
	. the strings seated too low, there's an angle with the bridge, which is higher
	. so the action is too low and the strings buzz
	. to fix action and intonation, all we can do is raise the bridge ridiculously high
	. so the angle is higher but the strings are raised up on the lower frets
	. obviously, intonation is fucked either way
	. so: we need a NEW new nut, with corrected string height,
	making sure we have a good reference for it
	. the nut's grooves were angled on the high strings too,
	so avoid that
- tuning proves difficult; increased neck bow, will continue later
- tuner assembly, restringing
- nut correctly glued
- glued nut, first attempt failed (~4h clamped), now new attempt with 24h clamp
- cleaned/oiled/waxed fretboard
- leveled/recrowned frets a bit, but they're still not level;
low frets are thinned too much already
- polish/wax
- new graphtech nut from blank
- more fronting, better
- really varnish back, better, this time taped everything tightly
- only one tusq is of necessary size for this nut, 1/4" one
- neck varnish front and back
