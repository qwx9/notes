# RBMK1000 TODO

## Build
- body: back varnish
- transfer drawings and shit to body...?
	* might be too late for that
	* radioactive catclock (haha)
	* chernobyl propaganda
- logo
	* rbmk1000 in the right font
	* alles l√∂schen, or even pico art of the panel
- neck: front varnish
- mirror polish/wax
- lemon oil/wax fretboard
- level frets
- shield cavity, fuck it
- assemble

## Mods
- jb pickup, as in convert to precision jazz
- active pickups

## Log
- last coats for neck, first two coats for body
- painted the rest, back looks different, but whatever
- looks sort of ok with more sanding, painted back on the edges
- renamed to RBMK1000, the yellow is just as sickening
- yellow varnish on body, result sucks,
but it might be salvageable;
going to sand mostly center and right and make a gradient towards the left
- varnished neck clear, 2 coats
