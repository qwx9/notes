## Log
- 2nd bottom and wing fixup on body
- 2nd neck coat with front
- masked neck, first thick coat with front and sides
- final body varnish and sanding, with some fixups; thick coat leaves droplets which are thick with varnish and hard to remove without leaving holes
- logo transfered, this technique isn't great, it transfers the paper, not the ink;
it works with a white background though, or covering the entire surface
- logo done
- what works best for the varnish is a thick coat which we then easily sand
- new varnish coat + smooth sanding in between
- sanded cleanly with sander + manually for corners and sides, neck
- clean up; naked corners, varnished again
- body varnish done but messy; began cleanup and there's a few spots with naked wood still
- front done, first layer on back, not great
- last coats for neck, first two coats for body
- painted the rest, back looks different, but whatever
- looks sort of ok with more sanding, painted back on the edges
- renamed to RBMK1000, the yellow is just as sickening
- yellow varnish on body, result sucks,
but it might be salvageable;
going to sand mostly center and right and make a gradient towards the left
- varnished neck clear, 2 coats
