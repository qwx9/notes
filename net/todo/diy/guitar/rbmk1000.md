# RBMK1000 TODO

## Build: body
- mirror polish/wax body
- shield cavity (and guard), fuck it
- assemble body
- guard is white and can be drawn on â†’ draw on it, or transfer, or print
	. can seal with the transparent poly varnish
	. black/white clashes with the rest of the finish
	. so maybe stain, patinage
		* lib/i/alien/chernobyl//aadbc30248b04b036b86e68d5a78e858.jpg
		* one idea is to yellow it and put text
		* like, rbmk schematics, with tears, stains, etc.
	. but, we can do this later when we get a good idea,
	it's trivial to remove the guard

## Build: neck
- sand front and back
- mirror polish/wax neck
- assemble neck
- level frets
- lemon oil/wax fretboard
- tuning: ?

## Mods
- cut guard down to cover less of the body, it's fugly
- jb pickup, as in convert to precision jazz
- different wiring schemes
- active pickups
- art: actual knobs as used on the control panels,
az-5 functional kill-switch, etc

## Log
- neck head requires more sanding and varnishing due to fuckups with droplets
- first polishing attempt: drill is not the way to go,
rotation speed to fast, difficult/impossible to keep it slow,
but works by hand...  with a lot of patience
- cleaning varnish drops on fretboard with boxcutter,
this paper tape fucking sucks
- final varnish and heavy fixups for neck/headstock
	. new heavy varnish coats technique is pretty flawed,
	the drops forming on the bottom are a problem,
	and always require fixing afterwards with new coats
- final varnish and fixups for body
- 2nd bottom and wing fixup on body
- 2nd neck coat with front
- masked neck, first thick coat with front and sides
- final body varnish and sanding, with some fixups; thick coat leaves droplets which are thick with varnish and hard to remove without leaving holes
- logo transfered, this technique isn't great, it transfers the paper, not the ink;
it works with a white background though, or covering the entire surface
- logo done
- what works best for the varnish is a thick coat which we then easily sand
- new varnish coat + smooth sanding in between
- sanded cleanly with sander + manually for corners and sides, neck
- clean up; naked corners, varnished again
- body varnish done but messy; began cleanup and there's a few spots with naked wood still
- front done, first layer on back, not great
- last coats for neck, first two coats for body
- painted the rest, back looks different, but whatever
- looks sort of ok with more sanding, painted back on the edges
- renamed to RBMK1000, the yellow is just as sickening
- yellow varnish on body, result sucks,
but it might be salvageable;
going to sand mostly center and right and make a gradient towards the left
- varnished neck clear, 2 coats
