# RBMK1000 TODO

## Build
- neck: 3rd coat varnish
- sand body
- transfer drawings and shit to body...?
	* i want a catclock head
	* mixing some black ink could make a nice contrast,
	but just the drawings would be enough
- body: 2 more varnish coats on front/sides
- body: back varnish
- rename, logo
- neck: front varnish
- fretboard finish
- level frets
- assemble

## Mods
- jb pickup, as in convert to precision jazz
- active pickups

## Log
- renamed to RBMK1000, the yellow is just as sickening
- yellow varnish on body, result sucks,
but it might be salvageable;
going to sand mostly center and right and make a gradient towards the left
- varnished neck clear, 2 coats
