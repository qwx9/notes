# Random design notes

## head

- headless
- nut: some self-lubricating shit from template?
- base design 1 drills holes parallel to the neck in two rows for spacing
and attaches picture hooks to wrap the strings on (but nylon strings, the hooks aren't strong)


## neck

- handmade, through body
- 8 or 9 string (or 8½? could be a nice joke)
- need truss rod of specific type? and carbon rods?
- enough to just get some 2x4 or w/e?
- wide enough for 8/9 strings, strong but as thin as possible, see what is usually done
- usual scale for fanfret (25.5"?)
- perhaps set everything up with a specific tuning, string gauge, action in mind
	* lowest would be d standard equivalent for 8/9 string, seems like a nice tradeoff


## fretboard

- fan fret
- jumbo xl or bigger frets
- scalloped frets? not sure if it's a joke or not
- inlays would be cool, possibly phosphorescent fret markers or other silly bullshit


## body

- simplest shit possible
- following base design, can be just some random board from furniture, about as thick as the neck
- essentially a shelf board
- would be nice to experiment with switch/knob placement,
since we're not limited at all to pickguard area
- base design 2 adds an extension to the body for correct placement of the strap,
we could either make some kind of horn or bearing, or place the strap button elsewhere (head?);
must not impede on playing


## bridge

- base design 1 uses bridge from classical guitar on one side,
then wrap around using two sets of metal plates to allow strings to slide along the edge
(basically rollers made from two metal bolts and rings for each),
then uses the classical guitar's severed head with its tuners intact to hold the strings
- base design 2 uses a standard metal bridge (tuneomatic?),
then individual rollers for each string,
then a steinberger-type bridge to dispense with tuners
- between the two designs, it is evident we could make our own bridge using the stock tuners,
or some cheapshit bridges and parts


## electronics

- handwound single coil/humbuckers, 2 or 3, or better if we can do better
	* lots of choices for magnets, ones with individual pole height seem cool
- bjnh: swappable pickups via mounts, held by magnets or similar simple mechanisms
	→ swiss guitar design
- preamp
	* "conversion" kits are sold for "power" pots, also "power bridges"
- controls: similar to 47-tone strat mods or something better
- shielding if needed
- a killswitch would be nice
- if we have enough space to add microcontrollers we could do whatever


## base design: board and wrap around bridge

- very simple build
- uses a random neck cut and slightly modified to fit
- uses some additional cheap generic parts for wrapping the strings around
- one small repurposed wooden block + extension
- one design uses a classical guitar headstock to hold the strings on the backside
- the other uses a random headless bridge, but there might be other options
	* some have converted guitars to headless using stock tuners
- easy to make, easy to modify, easy to experiment with, especially for fretting
- could extend the design to make it even easier to modify, swap pickups etc
	* rails, plugs for the pickups, w/e


## other design direction: gittler or similar

- need more details on construction
- main problem is working with metal
