# distorsion/other pedals

- parts already available, just need to get started
- read on the basic ideas and what can affect tone, etc.

## distorision pedals

- there are schematics for clones of popular distorsion pedals
- but: complicated builds
	* need making a circuitboard
	* condensing all of this shit into pedal-sized board
	means tricky soldering
- and, they are still only clones, sometimes with more controls
- we already have several of these pedals, factory-made
- in other words, what could we actually do better?
