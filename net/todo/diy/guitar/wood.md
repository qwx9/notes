# Notes on wood and materials

## Bamboo

Bamboo seems like a cool material to use here.
Some companies make bamboo guitars
(though other woods are used in conjunction),
like Alquier guitars.


## Single piece neck + fretboard

Can be done with the same material.
Fretboard usually needs to be harder wood to resist contact with strings.

On the other hand, with high frets and higher gauge strings,
and especially scalloped frets, this probably won't matter as much.
In fact Yngwie Malmsteen's scalloped guitars use the same wood.
See also: Gittler.

The question is installing the truss rod (and reinforcement rods):
must be done either from the top (glued fretboard),
or the back.
Either way, marking the fretboard will have to be done differently,
since we don't just have a flat board to work with.


## Exotics

Black lamba looks GREAT.
It's sold in slabs appropriate for a body for about 100eu on ebay.

Olive wood looks nice too, but very expensive.

Sycamore can be nice...  Search for handmade sycamore cutting boards,
there are some really beautiful ones, but wouldn't be able to use them
for a body...  OR WOULD WE?  Not a traditional one anyway!
