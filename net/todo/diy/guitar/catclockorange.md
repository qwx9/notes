# a catclock orange: bj186-based boden clone

## overall:
- fine sand neck (+water)
- fine sand body 120/240/400 (+water)
	. QUESTION: remove veneer? doesn't look that good anyway
	=> is there a proper way to do this
- decide on the artwork (see below)
- NOTE: have to drill additional 2x4 screws for the pup mounts
- stain/artwork for neck and body both
- finish/wax/oil/whatever (see below)
- install new circuitry (see below)
- fret/fingerboard fixups and oil/wax
- install neck
- assemble
- tuning: which is the lowest possible?


## artwork
- see [stack/art](stack)
- front and back, neck also
- idea 1: (mostly) black and white, catclock orange, big catclock and a reference + jigsaw
- idea 2: nopenopenope, failure is imminent; some color at least
- idea 3: sl artwork? see [notes](stack)
- idea 4: all of the above
- ok, here's the problem: slapping pure white everywhere will look shitty
	. some gretch guitars and other rg-styles do have white everywhere,
	but i don't think that looks that good;
	usually neck is not colored unless it's part of the body
	. better: white with black visible grain
		* kesler and others have made such finishes and they look gorgeous
	. this requires open-grained wood, which we have at least on the back
	. so, we could do that
	. or, we could try to add artwork (same color as grain) on top of that
	. OR: we can try using different colors for the grain! maybe draw artwork that way
		* artwork = catclock
- see one of the videos found: black stain + silver grain, looks great
- perhaps we could do light stain + black grain and carve artwork?
- another idea is to remove the front veneer,
do a nice stain which accentuates the grain,
transfer inked artwork on top, then just finish


## finish
- previous varnishing attempts were pretty shit,
the varnish we used doesn't seem much resistant to shock at all
- so, this is another chance to do better
- how thick must the layers be?
- how many layers?
- how long does the varnish need to cure?
- otherwise, there's no real indication that other varnishes
may be that much more stronger
- next, oil/wax/buffing: see precise info on the subject,
check the book
- finally, this depends on the artwork above
	. we could leave the grain instead of filling it
	in which case we have to use different techniques


## circuits
- right now: active pickups, 3-way switch, 2 pots
- without doing more drilling/routing, can we do better?
- kh602 has 3 pots, 2 volume + 1 tone
- so we want to do basically this, but with 2 pots


## log
- measurements: we could fit the battery on the bottom of the cavity cover
opposite the switch, but have to be careful
- initial neck reshaping
- hardware unsoldered
- disassembled
