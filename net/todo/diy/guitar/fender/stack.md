# fender guitar mods

## specs, notes, issues

- [guitar specs](/guitar/fender/specs)
- would be nice to not change the pickups


## project notes

- we want a useful fucking guitar without modifying essential parts
- meaning, we won't change pickups unless no other possbility
(or playing around)
- we don't play usual shit strats are used for
- so, low or very low tunings: d/c/b standard
- scale is wrong for such low tunings: 25.5" â†’ 28", 30" needed
- but, we'll do what we can at least for c-d standard


## goal: from the above

- playable prog metal guitar, despite missing high frets and notes
- lower tuning, at least d standard
- fix outstanding construction and electronics issues
- better, more useful wiring and configurations
- better tuning stability
- higher pickup output
- not the main guitar, playground for any kind of interesting bullshit


## body and construction

- repair/replace dented frets
- nut of appropriate height
- self-lubricating nut of appropriate height
(higher is better since we can file it down)
- copper foil shielding


## electronics

- re-wiring for better controls
	* have a button, but can add push-pull pots
	* or even more buttons (A PIANO! WOAH)
- convert to active pickups?
	* this doesn't mean anything
	* either we have to exchange with active pickups
	* or add an onboard pre-amp, noting that this isn't the same thing
- additional on-board electronics for shits
	* passive or msp430/arduino/pi/whatever based
	* preamp, tuning, effects, whatever
	* pitch up/down
- think of what other ridiculous shit we could tack on
	* besides blinkenlights
- different capacitor values


## blackjack and hookers

- diy single coil pickups
- diy single coil humbuckers?
- diy active single coil pickups?
- diy blade pickups?


## $$$ modifications

- [locking tuners](/guitar/parts/locking.tuners),
requires some woodwork for larger tuner holes
- [locking nut](/guitar/parts/locking.nut) + appropriate bridge
- single-coil sized humbuckers
