# diy guitar?

- obviously more expensive than just buying one,
but less fun

- 7/8 strings â‡’ specific construction:
size of the fretboard, nut, tuners, bridge, everything

- a luthier could provide the body and neck,
but less fun

- otherwise, tools for woodwork and a workshop are required,
none might be available
