# ⑨ST: (9) stratocaster, model fgd135

## todo: body
- add wood to the neck joint sides, there's slack on both sides;
glue wood then chip and sand
	. just use the wood filler
- don't sand/polish yet until the rest is done!
- install neck for correct measurements
	. possibility: longer scale, if at all possible
	. check if that would help for lower tunings at all, that would be the principal use
	. otherwise, just for like d std or something
- enlarge tremolo cavity for corrected measurements (deepen),
clean up edges (watch the paint! and mark tremolo position on cavity walls)
- drill tremolo support holes
- drill tremolo spring plate holes and place the plate
- drill strap peg holes (test the strapshits first), place pegs
- drill pick guard holes
- drill holes for jack plate
- enlarge cavity if needed
- sand cavity for smooth surface, maybe put a coat of varnish
(like the colored one? or waterbased one?)
- 2pass-sand/varnish/finish guitar cavity (maybe no varnish, for mods)
- drill/enlarge whatever holes are needed for the wiring
- cover cavities with copper tape
- sand varnish + wax + mirror polish (?)
- place wired pickguard and output jack plate
- place tremolo bridge/springs
- place strings and springs and setup action, intonation for tuning: dstd
(? see above)


## todo: neck
- sand head varnish
- drill for tuners
- sand/polish/wax head and neck at least for the tuner install
- drill for neck joint
- scallop frets? probably don't need to go super deep
	. try it on the first position, fretboard is damaged there anyway
	. make sure only the *middle* is scalloped, fret must be held tight
	. could probably wax over it (maybe with the purple wax?
	. would be nice to be able to test it out first (cut part of the fingerboard clean?
	. this won't work well, it will fuck up the inlays,
	it's very hard to do at the upper frets,
	and will need precision to not chip the fret supports;
	leave this for later when attempting refretting,
	otherwise impossible
	=> fuck this, not a good idea with fretboard
- install tuners
- install neck for body work, fix some strings for measurements
- level, polish frets
- possibly replace frets with jumbo xl, these are pretty low
	. if we do that, have to do it now
	. so maybe later on another headstock
- extend fingerboard somehow?
- fingerboard finish
- string up, tune

## todo: electronics
- decide on wiring for HSH passive pickups setup
	* phase switch, split coils switch
	* would be nice to get some additional useful combinations,
	or maybe just have all of them and test all?
		. we probably don't really need to switch between all of these quickly
	* would be nice to have individual volume pots instead of 2 tone pots?
	* would be even nicer to be able to test shit easily
- preamp? sustainer? octave? octave would be great
- move switch position further forward for easier access
- perhaps move tone controls back, we mostly want volume; check what makes sense
- cut, sand, drill pick guard to fit humbuckers and altered body and neck
- plan for new pick guard template for blank, to be done later
- cover pick guard inner side with copper tape
- wire pick guard


## log
- last varnish coat for body + fixing bottom drips
	. if there isn't too much shit,
	can varnish directly without sanding
- 2nd varnish coat, droplets on bottom like rbmk, no choice but smushing them
before it's set and fixing them later during sanding;
this coat applied without sanding, first coat absorbed by wood
- first body varnish coat, looks great (should've been diluted, but forgot)
- body painting done, marks could not be removed, rough surfaces all round,
new damage from moving around, inevitable...
back side looks good, front less so
- neck varnishing done, ready for polishing then assembly
- new neck varnish layer
- new paint technique: small amount, spread as much as possible with a finger
	* good results, especially on back
	* MUST let it rest a few hours to dry properly,
	the guitar was overturned to work the back and the front was marked
- sanded near perfectly with sander
- neck could be redone as well at the same time for better results
	* could attempt refretting too, but maybe later,
	once we have a neck to ruin
- SO: sand body AGAIN but with the machine
and have an absolutely smooth fucking surface,
THEN paint thinly THEN sand THEN varnish;
- important lessons:
	* sanding by hand fucking sucks
	* much better to use a machine and get appropriate sandpaper
	* slightly less good: sanding block for flat surfaces
	* before paint/etc, wood has to be absolutely perfect
	* 80→180→240→320(maybe), with repeated water grain raising
	until grain no longer rises
	* then, paint → sand → varnish/lacquer
	→ light sanding between each layer → polish/buff/wax
	* varnishing step doesn't work well currently,
	varnish bubbles, and don't know how to avoid that;
	cleaning brush with white spirit seems to exacerbate that
	* polishing before sanding varnish perfectly will NOT help
	* fretwork must be delicate and avoid bruising the fucking fretboard
	* hammer → level → recrown → clean → oil → wax
- more body sanding, last neck coats
- first coats front neck varnish
	* varnishes so far are bad quality: too much varnish applied,
	and a lot of drippage
	* need a proper jig for this, esp for body,
	to do the entire piece at once
- transferred logo, but bad placement...
- final results:
	* polyurethane transfer gives best results for other people,
	but doesn't work here at all (not with inkjet?)
	* lasers, acetone not that great
	* label paper transfer with inkjet gives best results
	as long as quality is set to lowest
	and there is the minimum amount of ink,
	otherwise it forms droplets
	* transfer is immediate, smearing is easy, and cleanup impossible
	* works on bare, well sanded wood, not paint or varnish (but not 100% sure)
	* can varnish on top just fine once it's completely dry,
	which can take a few days
	* transfers from laser printers might work much better,
	esp with varnish...
- transfer attempts: we're using label paper and inkjet printer,
L paper size 100% scale;
the transfer doesn't work well at all;
the ink doesn't penetrate the wood well and is easily wiped off,
which kind of sucks if we varnish over it;
black ink can be used in combination, same result,
but have to have a steady hand (i don't);
need something else...
- made logo, renamed
- sand → third coat, overall seems to have worked ok;
when varnishing, the entire fretboard must be masked,
the varnish may leak underneath
- sand → second coat; paintbrush is a very bad idea, don't do that
- first coat of floor varnish
- scraped/sanded varnish away, painted back of guitar:
wide strokes and push force help thin the paint down,
so we won't have to sand like crazy;
will apply glossy clear polyurethane floor varnish
after cleaning with white spirit/steel wool real quick
- third coat; overall result: not super great.
seems we've applied too much varnish and the top is bumpy from the residue;
areas where it didn't apply cleanly are fucky;
have to sand it to get anything good;
holes aren't really covered or anything, that's good;
doesn't really penetrate like the water based varnish, just sits on top and can be peeled off;
not sure this really provides that much shock resistance, more uv/heat which is meh;
polyurethane floor varnish is a much better idea
- second coat of varnish on neck; very important to have a clean environment
so as to not embed shit in the varnish,
but here it's very dusty...
makeshift clean chamber accessed only with gloves or something?
- first coat of varnish on neck
- sand neck
- lock nut screws are shit, one stripped completely, need replacement:
m2 18mm black flat philips screw
- shortened neck to fit the socket better, should be just fine now
- cut head down to size, still 1mm off, have to be lopped off the front,
not the sides, since it's flush; otherwise perfect!
have to measure 25.5" from the *edge/end* of the saddles, not middle,
so we're nearly perfect, and string clearance is fine, but have to watch out
- traced for tuner holes, will have to do everything else before drilling shit
- drilled and installed locking nut and retainer bar
- cut down nut bolts to be flush against its base
- head: cut and sand fretboard for locking nut placement
- REpainted all over again; just the grain looks like shit,
we'll paint again instead and sand to a thin layer so the grain shows
- painted all over and began sanding it away again
- 180→240→water→240 sanding again
- sanded all the paste away
- spraying with water before final sanding particularly effective
- lots of scratches and shit will remain...
- enlarged tremolo cavity; it's no longer a snug fit on the sides;
place using post notches and neck position
- checked neck position; moving tremolo back 2-3mm to use previous tremolo post notches
- sanding manually all the wood paste; other methods aren't soft enough, and this doesn't really waste too much sandpaper as long as it's cleaned up, only one sheet thrown so far
- sanded wood paste all the way to leave only grain; result doesn't look great; will apply just red paint and sand again, test looks good
- noticed tremolo position is wrong yet again, we have 22fret; measured 7mm difference, will subtract from both bridge and neck since bridge support will be too thin
- applied wood paste mixed with some red paint on all surface
- retraced tremolo position and chiseled further forward
- filled tremolo holes with wood paste by multiple layers
- noticed tremolo is too far back, used the wrong trace for saddle position, and peg holes too wide
- drilled tremolo peg holes, required thinning sides of the body because only a shitty column drill and little patience
- chiseled deeper middle/back for tremolo clearance and string fasteners clearance
- traced tremolo bridge position and chiseled exact shape into wood (circa 5mm), to be widened later
- measured tremolo bridge position for centered and 25.5" nut-saddle scale, assuming 21fret neck
- reinforced front and back of bridge holding section with 3mm steel plates
- deepened the c-shape notch for the fretting hand for easier access to high frets
