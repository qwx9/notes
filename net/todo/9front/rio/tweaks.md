# rio tweaks

## exit menu item

- ask for confirmation before really exiting


## rio labels

- could be nice to add an option to label rio's window on start up

- or a way for label(1) to attempt it on its rio window

- a riostart script with this works:

	echo -n $label >/dev/label

- heredoc wouldn't work, the file needs to be executable


## obtrusive file list

see [riow todo](/todo/setup/9front/rio/riow)

- could hide it in a menu item

- could always use winwatch


## integrate with sam/samterm, or sam into it

- ability to call sam or other utils for any window

- command window?

- can just plumb /dev/text, see [here](/9front/usage/rio/tips)
