# riow tweaks

## improvements?

- reverting full screen would be nice, but needs state;
simple enough to modify riow script?


## bugs/peculiarities

- needs to set kbmap to us or w/e, otherwise Kmod4 never seen
- too much flashing, seems some windows get hidden then unhidden
then hidden again while switching


## remove forced sticky windows

- remove everything except desktop from $sticky at the top
