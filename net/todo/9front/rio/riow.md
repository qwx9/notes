# riow tweaks

- reverting full screen would be nice, but needs state;
simple enough to modify riow script?


## rio file list

see [rio todo](/todo/setup/9front/rio/tweaks)

- rio window list is now obtrusive since it lists everything

- selecting a window in it will move that window to current
desktop


## remove forced sticky windows

- remove everything except desktop from $sticky at the top
