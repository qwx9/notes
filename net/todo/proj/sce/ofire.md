# ofire.pcx approximation

## probably still have to re-adjust ofire alpha

- scbw has an aura that "colors" the ground as well as the shadow etc,
ours is very very subtle
- in fact it almost looks like it's a stair function,
not a simple logistic one: fires are high alpha, glow
is drastically lower, then cuts off
