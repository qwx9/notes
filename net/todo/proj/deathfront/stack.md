# deathfront: technical/progressive death metal generation

## inspiration

- relentless doppelganger
- uses neural nets on a dataset of archspire, fast technical deathmetal
- two papers on arxiv
- output: sound, directly
- many limitations, and output is not great
- fast technical deathmetal yields best results wrt stability


## basic idea

- don't use songs as input
- technical deathmetal songwriting can be decomposed into musical elements
- so use rythmic structures and intervals, and whatever else information could enrich the model
- this seems to lend itself to a hmm model, trained on data
- we can then select "good" tracks and feed them back to the model
or to machine learning methods to improve prediction
- works on technical deathmetal = works on any music?
	* can experiment with easier stuff first, like basic chord progressions
	* rock improv is especially stupidly codified
	* punk, grunge, garage rock etc can have fairly simple structures,
	esp for rhythm instruments
	* djent is relatively simple and would make a great joke too


## (9) band

- use this to actually "write" songs: artificial artistry!
- mm/neural networks/bullshit(1) approach
to generate (ineligible) band logos, artwork, lyrics, track names, album names
- basically, metal(1) or music(1) for band generation
