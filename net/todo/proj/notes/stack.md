# notes stack

## plumb rule for notes

- use note/add to add a file prefixed with... something,
or suffixed with \.md?
but it's not the only file on the system using that extension

- maybe enough to have note/ls etc print rc commands one can plumb


## add note/mv

- move note from one dir to another, clean up parent dirs
