# note plumbing

- plumb note links from text within rio
- and/or B note links from within sam
- use note/add to add a file prefixed with... something,
or suffixed with \.md?
but it's not the only file on the system using that extension
- maybe use note:// or utf8 or something
- sam exposes $% and $%dot, file and dot
	* if these can be seen when sending a plumb command, we're golden
	* otherwise we have to use a script
	* perhaps we can dynamically add commands to samterm's 2nd mouse menu
	* or have a couple of slots
