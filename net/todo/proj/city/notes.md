# city(1) unstructured notes

=> initially, fuck it, random stats, we want the framework
	we won't put everything in either
we lack timing info (upgrades, builds) and higher level upgrade costs
	so set the same ones everywhere for now
mills get 1 field automatically
terraforming: wood 75, pond 75, field 20, plain 50
	field doesn't need to be adjacent, but it can be converted from other terrain
swamp, unbuildable terrain (also mountains etc)
also travel time to deliver needed materials
upkeep percentage: multiply upkeep
upkeep levels: add +1 to affected counters
we'll set upkeep for 20%
build cost can actually be upgrade level0
20% prod (lvl1, 40%: *= 2)
