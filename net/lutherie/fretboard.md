# fretboards

## scalloping
- see yngwie malmsteen fender models
- maple necks without a fretboard are pretty much required,
otherwise the fretboard will be destroyed
- also, inlays
- this will require handiwork, esp. on the higher frets
	. the frets musn't lose their support
- overall, whether this is useful when one can just install higher frets: dunno,
but maybe could be even combined with high frets
