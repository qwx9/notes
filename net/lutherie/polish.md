# Polishing

## workflow for mirror polish
- no consensus on precise procedure, but there's a general outline
- first dry sand with 1000 grit, to reveal imperfections
- then sand with water with 1000→1500→2000 grit;
clean often, use a sponge or something soft as a sanding block,
one 20x20cm area at a time, don't drench in water
- then use eg. cutting/rubbing compound, one 20x20cm area at a time
- then polishing compound
- then wax, etc.


## car polishes

### tried
- kitautos pc112 500mL cutting+polishing compounds
	. pretty slow use, but works
	. not sure that it's really the cheapest one

### cutting compound
- often first step in a 2-pass
- not quite the same as rubbing compound
- use *on top* of sanding to achieve good gloss
- by machine on a car, but by hand on wood, unless low rotations speeds are possible
- either way, expect using a bunch by small area to get good results

### polishing compound
- apply after cutting compound
- use for actual mirror finish
