# varnishing

## oil-based
- le tonkinois is pretty good quality and works well,
though requires 24h between layers
- max 3-4 layers for wood like guitar, 8 or more for ships, but people put way more
- cleanup: white spirit is sufficient
- first layer recommended to be diluted to 5% in white spirit
- sanding in between can help better adherence
- avoid overworking the varnish


## application
- this far, easiest has been hanging the piece,
then applying heavy coats of varnish with a small brush
- this avoids bubbling and smoothes out nicely,
some heterogeneities in distribution will occur,
but sanding is required afterwards anyway, so who cares
- problem: droplets get collected on the bottom,
which don't really dry because of their volume;
sanding them then just pokes a hole in the varnish
- require good masking tape for shit that mustn't be varnished,
otherwise it'll drip everywhere
	. regular scotch tape works fine,
	packaging tape leaves residue that requires acetone for proper cleanup,
	sucks ass
- small brushes work better here, with good flexible and lightweight bristles,
beware of cheapshit plastic ones,
varnish application will suck if the bristles are too rough and scratch everything
- beware of brush cleanup: brush needs to dry after cleaning in white spirit,
otherwise it bubbles a lot
- that's also why a smaller brush is better,
it cleans up in white spirit easier,
and retains less particles and other shit in the bristles,
thus also staying flexible longer
- when leaving in white spirit, make sure to turn and squeeze brush hairs every which way
to ensure good penetration/exposure
- NOTE: if there are fuckups, they should be fixed before applying more layers,
otherwise it's a huge pain and things will have to be sanded down anyway
