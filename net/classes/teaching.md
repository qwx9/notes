# potential teaching (lol)

. there's not much content for highly technical topics
. accelerated learning with sm2 and note taking/mind maps
. basic computer programming concepts
	* why are you here?
		- learn on your own, solid grasp?
		- or professional needs, just quick and fast programming?
		- if former, more classes
	* how to learn it
	* should i use c? java? forth? haskell?
	* differences between languages: what is suited for what
		- data science: excel or R
		- system programming
		- compilers, parsers, algorithmics
	* what is source code, how does it work
	* basic link between electronics and code
	* what does the machine do
	* what is optimization: it doesn't write itself
	* what this isn't
	* realize it's the same everywhere
. quick basic c course: find out how to make it sexy
	* c89? c11? c17?
. intermediate/advanced c course?
	* programming style
	* parallel programming
	* debugging, analysis
	* the unix programming environment
	* optimization, iterative development etc
	* essential algorithms, data structures, methods
. c system programming with plan9/unix => computer architecture classes
. c basic audio programming?
	* what is digital audio
	* how does computer audio work?
		driver -> kernel -> userland -> routing -> mixing
	* working with pcm samples
	* underneath the libraries and drivers
	* fft
	* analysis
	* link to modern libraries?
. R for data science, basic statistics etc?
	* should you even learn R? i think so
	etc
. intermediate/advanced R
	* ggplot2, visualization
	* parallelization, bigmemory, etc
	* optimization, performance
	* best practices
. c basic graphics programming?
. functional programming with ocaml/julia?
. in french as well
. plan9/bsd/unix?
. unix: cross-distribution/os fundamentals
	* sh scripting
	* awk, sed, grep, regex, etc
	* package management
	* administration stuff...
	* starting from a barebones distro: void/alpine/etc
	* disk formatting
	* etc
	* in fact many of these can be their own courses if exceeding 1-2h
. c pathfinding
	* djikstra, a*
	* jps and optimizations
	* non-optimal pathfinding, heuristics, approximate pathfinding
	* shortcuts used in games
	* any angle
. there's nothing on bayesian statistics
. there's nothing on metal guitar!
	* we can teach some metal techniques
	* drills, rsi prevention
	* alternative picking and playing in one position
	* songs (have to improve a bit)
		- heavy metal
		- trash metal
		- death metal
		- neu metal? black metal?
		- prog metal
. there's nothing on guitar electronics (probably pedals either)
. i guess highly technical topics might be a good idea,
there's not much besides beginner courses
. other shit we've done over time? biochem? biology? etc?
. seems like a good idea...
. maybe show odd, ask for tips on making the courses sexier
	* equipment, editing, etc
. once we've advanced sufficiently with sce, could do something on
  building a game from the ground up without many libraries
  (on linux)
. taking classes/premium: have to be regular for it to be worth it
	* wood work
	* electronics
	* music
