# blackview bv9100 notes

## Problems
- usbc cables are fucked,
and must wiggle the connector into a certain position to get it to charge.
Position changes all the time.
It gets harder and harder to find until it can't be.
Possible fix is to get a normal connector length usbc cable
and flatten it so it barely clears the opening.
ugreen usbcâ†’jack adaptor seems to work fine that way,
but attaching it to the bv9100-shipped usbc extension thing
fucks the connection out.
