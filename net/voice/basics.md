# basic notes and exercises

## vocal range

- f2-c5 extreme range, basically classic tenor
- maybe leeway for 1-2 semitones lower and higher,
but with a lot of effort
- going this high is straining
- piano32 practice helps


## keyboard

- mkey -s
- games/dmid -s /dev/usb/ep10.4/data | games/opl3 | norm 5 >/dev/audio
- mkey | games/dmid -s | games/opl3 | norm 5 >/dev/audio
