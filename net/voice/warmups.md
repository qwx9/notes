# warm-ups


## routine: do this FIRST

- z's 5-4-3-2-1
	* feel the expansion of the ribcage and dump
- z's 1-2-3-2-1
- french doorbell: "æn", 3 sounds setting up above the pencil
	* e02 8:00
	* tight like steel bookshelf on cheekbones
	* above the pencil EE, feeling like a click
	* deeper EE with more lows
	* don't push down on the larynx, must stay level
	* on a♯2
- 1-2-3-2-1 with last EE sound
	* but aim for the top of the note
	* starting with g♯2
- 1-2-3-2-1-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1
	* same sound
	* use your arm, scooping up: reach up
	* feel but don't sound: we don't want a bend
	* clear jump, no tremors, no hesitations


## common

- 1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1 raise to top then lower to bottom
- lip bubble
- mum
- every vowel at every pitch
	* AH (father)
	* EE (eat)
	* IH (pin)
	* EH (pet)
	* OO (food)
	* UH (hut)
	* EU (could)
	* OH (home)


## pitch accuracy

- use piano32 and tuner
- it actually helps nailing the right tone,
and the right feel
(at least somewhat)
- sing sharp, limited
- this is where fplay with musical notes would be useful...
