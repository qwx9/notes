# basic breathing and exercises

## key concepts

- by the way breath with ribcage
- over the pencil
- dump when getting louder


## setup

- lie down
- make left fist, place dorsal side on lower floating ribs
- right hand flat on abdomen
- goal: separate awareness of ribcage expansion,
diaphragm breathing (up/down),
and prohibit using chest
- counts don't need to be slow


## exercise 1

- full exhale
- 8 counts breathe in from nose
	* expand ribcage
	* do not use chest if counting short
- 4 counts hold
	* no strain, just suspend
- open jaw
- 4 counts exhale from diaphragm
	* let abdomen sink
- 4 counts exhale from ribcage
exhale all the air out of the body, then breathe in from nose, 8 counts, expanding ribcage
	* do not use chest if counting short
	* hold for 4 beats
	* don't hold breath with strain like smoking a joint
	* just suspend, levitate
- repeat 3 times


## exercise 2

- same as 1, but do not open jaw
- kiss lips and blow, full cheeks


## exercise 3

- same as 2, but exhale softly, fully, and without outgoing count
- pretend there's a feather floating above the mouth
- keep it there by exhaling softly,
for as long as possible


## exercise 4

- expand ribcage: split the sides
	* keep shoulders relaxed
- 10 counts pant with diaphragm only
	* keep ribcage static
- exhale and let go
- the point is that the ribcage remains a reserve
	* we don't breathe in from nil,
	but reboost the ribcage


## over the pencil

- by thinking about the voice going over the pencil,
we force several phenomena
	* larynx lies lower in the throat
	* the throat becomes a reverb chamber
	* the vibrations bounce off the skullbone
	* and it feels like it's going over the pencil
- compare above and below the pencil
	* the tone below the pencil is less rounded off and more crunchy
- this helps keep you from raising up for a high note
and losing all your resonance
- pitch plays an important role here
	* pitching over the pencil will probably be spot on,
	* but from below, it would be right underneath
	* doing this even helps you hear your voice,
	resonating in your skull,
	without the need for monitors at a concert
	* relieves tension as well
- below the pencil will be used a lot for screaming (heat/fire)
- but for warm ups, we'll use over the pencil
- try "yip" from low to high note thinking about this


## tone

- vocal chords tighten for high notes and loosen for low notes
- there's a set amount of notes accomodated in each "gear"
	* and there's almost like a clutch,
	a gear shift that must happen to make it to the next note
- people typically reach up straining like crazy
for high notes, and scoop down for low notes
	* these gears make it feel like there's a ceiling and a floor
	* that's called static registration
- dynamic registration: being able to move through those gears
without a change in voice
	* the clutch is just the dump,
	which helps the vocal chords come together smoothly
	as they stretch and loosen rather than slipping
	* visually, from low to high,
	we'd go east to west instead of south to north
	(curve, not stairs)
	* no more low or high notes, just notes


## strain

- vocal chords are muscles that touch
and vibrate together in a certain frequency
	* overstraining them makes them inflamed,
	swollen up and puffy, preventing contact
	⇒ whispering
	* then, when they touch accidentally,
	you get short whisper to voice transitions
	⇒ hoarse voice
- overstraining them chronically will induce scar tissue
	* nodules: warts
	* polyps: blisters
	* in that case, the bump closes before the chords,
	and the voice breaks up between whispers and hoarse tones
- in case of swollen chords, e.g. hoarse voice,
you must stfu
	* vocal rest for 24h
	* meaning 24h of no talking, no sound
- if you completely lose your voice,
you must stfu for ≥ 5 days
- if not possible, there are talking warm ups
- but the best thing is to use the vocal chords right
